# AirPure Innovations — Market Fit & Air Quality Analytics (India)

## Project Description
AirPure Innovations is a startup developing next-generation air purifiers for the Indian market, where air pollution poses a critical public health challenge. With 14 Indian cities ranking among the world’s 20 most polluted, this project uses SQL to support data-driven product development, market entry, and R&D strategy.
I conducted an end-to-end market fit analysis by integrating air quality, health impact, vehicle growth, and population projection data to answer strategic questions posed by the CEO.

## Business Objectives
- Identify dominant air pollutants to guide filter technology selection
- Understand pollution severity and persistence across Indian regions
- Estimate market size and demand potential using population projections
- Analyze health impacts linked to poor air quality
- Detect temporal demand triggers driven by pollution spikes
- Align R&D and product features with localized pollution patterns

## Key Business Insights
- PM2.5 and PM10 emerged as dominant pollutants in major urban regions
- Metro cities show significant AQI improvement on weekends, indicating activity-driven pollution
- Pollution severity correlates with higher health event frequency, reinforcing preventive demand
- Vehicle growth does not show immediate correlation with AQI spikes, suggesting health-driven rather than mobility-driven demand
- Northern and densely populated states present the highest market urgency and scale
